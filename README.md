Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
Open the Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Secure_Healthcare_Network_System.pkt from the repository folder.
Start the simulation and observe the network’s behavior:

Monitor the secure communication between network devices.
Examine firewall and VPN configurations.
Review the traffic flow between different network segments.
Project Files
Simulation Files: The network topology and configuration are contained in the .pkt files. These files represent the healthcare network's infrastructure, security measures, and configuration settings.
Documentation: Detailed descriptions of the network design, configurations, and security practices used in this project.
Presentation: PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the network’s architecture, design rationale, and security protocols implemented in the project.
Security Considerations
This project incorporates several key security features aimed at protecting sensitive medical data and ensuring network integrity:

Encryption: Encrypts sensitive communication using protocols such as SSL/TLS.
Firewalls: Deployed at strategic points to protect the network from unauthorized access and external threats.
VPN (Virtual Private Network): Ensures secure remote access to the network for healthcare professionals.
Network Segmentation: Divides the network into logical segments, ensuring that critical systems (e.g., patient records, medical devices) are isolated from general network traffic.
Access Control: Restricts network access based on roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
